Objective: - Predict Next Sequence
To start with deep learning, the very basic project that you can build is to
predict the next digit in a sequence.

Dataset: - Create a sequence like a list of odd numbers and then build a model
and train it to predict the next digit in the sequence.

Task: - A simple neural network with 2 layers would be sufficient to build the
model.

Assignment Submission: - Only submit the Google Colab/Github link.(Make the
Link Public).
